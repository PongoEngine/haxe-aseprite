# haxe-aseprite
Haxe parser for .ase and .aseprite files.

This project was built for the Github Game jam. As it stands it has basic functionality for my needs HOWEVER I would love to make the parser valid for all .aseprite files.

So please please message me or request a pull request!

Also if you're having any problems getting this going let me know about your project and maybe we can make a tutorial together. Until then, happy coding. ^_^
